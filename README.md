Try Beef is an online editor to compile and run small Beef programs.

It is comprised of three parts:

1. The frontend client, which is a minimal Monaco editor.

2. The backend webserver for handling requests and running compilations

3. The Beef docker image, which uses a prebuilt BeefBuild binary for compilation
